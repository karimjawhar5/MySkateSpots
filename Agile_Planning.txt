My Skate Spots

Pitch:
Enabling skateboards to share their local skate spots, along with an image, a description, a rating, and a geo location, allowing other users to find those spots based on their location.

Architecture:

Front End:
- ReactJS for building the user interface and displaying the skateboarding spots
- A map library (such as Mapbox or Google Maps) for showing the location of skateboarding spots
- A user authentication system (such as Firebase Authentication) for allowing users to sign up, log in, and submit new spots
- A form for users to submit new spots, including fields for the spot name, description, location, and rating
- A page to expand on skate spots and read more about it.

Back-end:
- NodeJS for handling server-side logic
- ExpressJS for building the API and handling HTTP requests from the front-end
- A MySQL database for storing information about skateboarding spots, including the spot name, description, location, and rating
- A geo-coding API (such as Google Maps Geocoding API) for converting the user's location into latitude and longitude coordinates
